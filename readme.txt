...still waiting on Deon to make the movement.

****Hitting the Ball****
When you are close to the ball time will slow down allowing you
to move you camera in order to aim where you will hit the ball 
(if the ball is on or close to the ground you may have to crouch).
After you aim the ball click and hold the mouse down to change the
power of the hit.  Moving the mouse up will be a lob pass.  You
use the mouse scroll wheel to change the amount of arc on the pass.
Moving the mouse down will do a smashing hit.  Scrolling the wheel
down will add forward spin so the ball falls down quicker, scrolling
the wheel all the way forward will change to a floater hit with no 
spin on the ball.  To add horizontal horizontal curve you moving the 
mouse left or right (though no curve can be added to a floater).  
When ready release the mouse to hit the ball. If you are not 
satisfied with the angle of where your aiming, right click before
releasing the left mouse and you will be sent back to aiming.

****Penalties****
Hitting the ball more than once before hitting it over the net will
end the rally causing you to serve the ball.

****Serving****
Walk around in the back line until you find the spot where you want to
serve from.  Then left click and the ball will be transported to you.
Throw the ball up into the air, then hit.  This is the only time it is
allowed to hit the ball more than once.
